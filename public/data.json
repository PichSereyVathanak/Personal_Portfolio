        "problemStatement": "A telecommunications company was losing 20% of their customers annually but didn't know which customers were at risk. They needed a predictive model to identify high-risk customers before they leave.",
        "detailedDescription": "I developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that processes historical customer data including usage patterns, billing information, and demographics. The model uses ensemble methods combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms to achieve 87% accuracy. Feature engineering involved creating interaction features and temporal indicators. The solution enabled the company to implement targeted retention strategies.",
